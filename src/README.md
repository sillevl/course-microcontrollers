# Microcontrollers

This is the microcontrollers course for the devbit curriculum based on the ARM Cortex M4 microcontroller architecture & mbed development platform, applied at the Nucleo L476RG.

## Goals

Upon completion of this course one should be able to:

* Build microcontroller-based embedded systems & applications.
* Apply theoretical & practical knowledge of the microprocessor internal operation.
* Apply theoretical & practical knowledge of microcontroller peripherals, such as Timers, ADC, DAC, PWM.
* Apply theoretical & practical knowledge of common microcontroller interfaces, i.e. UART, SPI, I²C.
* Apply theoretical & practical knowledge of writing embedded software

1. Learn the internals of the STM32L476RGT6 microcontroller and program it on the register level.
2. Build embedded applications using the Nucleo L476RG prototyping board and mbed libraries.

## Lifelong learning

The technology domain in general is an ever changing and evolving domain. What you knew yesterday might not apply anymore, what you know today might not applicable tomorrow. Technology improves all the time. It is impossible to create a single course that covers it all. This course functions only as a **step** to more and other information. This course will provide a solid base to get some understanding in how everything works. Your goals or challenges will quickly surpass what we are able to bring you. Therefore it is important that you learn to gather the information you need for yourself. During the course many pointers to extra sources of learning or information will be provided. Add these sources to your toolbox in order to be successful in the future.

I encourage anyone to play, tinker, hack, experiment, try out new things... This is the easiest way to learn and understand things.

## Organisation

This course will be organized in multiple different ways:

* **On campus sessions**: Mostly theory is given. These sessions are scheduled in the class schedule and take place at the campus.
* **Online sessions**: Mostly theory is given. These sessions are scheduled in the class schedule and can be followed at home online.
* **Independent learning**: Theory that must be processed individually at your own pace. Mostly with a deadline.
* **On campus exercising sessions**: Sessions that are scheduled in the class schedule that will focus on the practical side of the course. Many exercises and challenges will be given to process at your own pace or with a deadline. This is the perfect moment to ask questions and get feedback.
* **Independent exercising**: Time to continue the challenges and exercises that are provided during the on campus exercising sessions.

## Course Evaluation

For this course you are evaluated in 2 different ways:

* 50% **Written exam**: Examination in the dedicated examination period in January.
* 50% **Permanent evaluation**: Process and exercise evaluation during the semester. Important: For this part, only 1/3th of the scores can be retaken!

For more information and the official details, please read the courses ECTS document.
